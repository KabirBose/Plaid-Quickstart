# Plaid Quickstart
The Plaid API has a complex implementation. This is my barebones quickstart guide, allowing you to easily implement Plaid into NextJS 14+ projects.

# Why my quickstart?
- Bun.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- React context for access token
- Plain with less code

# Get started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `bun install` (or use any other package manager)
3. Create a `.env.local` file consisting of your Plaid keys
4. Run the development server
